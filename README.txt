Heart Rate Correlation Analysis

Description:
Programs in this branch use experimental data gathered at an experiment in New Jersey Institute of Technology to investigate a possible correlation between ECG obtained heart rate, PPG obtained heart rate, and heart rate to PPG signal magnitude relation. The programs analyze the data and calculate the magnitude of the PPG signal with respect to the heart rate and ECG. The programs are written in MATLAB and uses a sample rate of 100 Hz.

The program will output the magnitude of the PPG signal with respect to the heart rate and ECG, and investigate if the magnitude of the PPG signal varies with respect to heart rate.
The program currently only uses the ECG and Green color PPG of the input data.
The program assumes a sample rate of 100 Hz.


Instructions:
Download all files and store them in the same folder.
Run any of the programs.

Notes:
Further analysis can be done to investigate the correlation between the heart rate and the magnitude of the PPG signal.
